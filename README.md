I am a student at Russian Technological University MIREA. And I'm obsessed 
with building things from scratch!

## Languages

I am a native Python speaker, but also love Zig and  Rust.

## Projects

I like building ML and AI models with Python, and implement some low-level 
utilities with Zig.

For example, you can check out [Scratches](https://github.com/mkashirin/scratches) 
for a comprehensive deep learning construction guide. Or if you would rather 
look at some low-level programming there are: [Filez](https://github.com/mkashirin/filez) — a 
simple file buffer over TCP; and [ZTCLI](https://github.com/mkashirin/ztcli) — minimal
CLI that combines ZeroTier Central and ZeroTierOne Service essential
functionality.

## Learning

Currently I am more into systems programming and trying to work out a way 
towards bare metal programming with Zig. But I also do ML and AI research and 
experiments on regular basis.

## Contacts

You can send me either a message in [Telegram](https://t.me/mk4shirin) or an email on m.k4shirin@yandex.ru.
