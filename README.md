# Hi!

My name is Micheal, I am a student at Russian Technological University MIREA. And I am obsessed with building 
things from scratch!

## Languages

I am a native Python speaker... but also love Zig! And on my way to learn a bit of Rust.

## Projects

I like building ML and AI models with Python, and implement some low-level utilities with Zig.

For example, you can check out Scratches for a comprehensive deep learning construction guide.
Or if you would rather look at some proper low-level programming, Filez — a simple file buffer over TCP — might
work for you.

## Learning

Currently I am more into systems programming and trying to work out a way towards bare metal programming with Zig.
But I also do ML and AI research and experiments on regular basis.

## Collaboration

As of now, I did not really have any experience in collaboration, but if you have an interesting idea, hit me up!
